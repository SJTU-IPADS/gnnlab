# Figure 5: Gap between degree-based policy and optimal.

The goal of this experiment is to show the gap between degree-based policy and optimal.

`runner.py` runs all necessary tests and redirect logs to directory `run-logs`.
`parser.py` parses results from log files and generate `data.dat`.
`plot.plt` plots corresponding figure to `fig5b.eps`.

degree-based results is done by running same tests like figure 4a, while the results of optimal requires an extra test and is calculated by profiling each batch's access(corresponding log file looks like `run-logs/report_optimal_..._optimal_cache_hit.txt`)

Fig 5a & 5b is similar, while 5a uses 3hop neighbour sampling on papers100M dataset, and 5b uses 3hop weighted sampling on twitter dataset.

## Hardware Requirements

- Paper's configurations: Two 16GB NVIDIA V100 GPUs
- For other hardware configurations, you may need to modify the cache percentage
  -  Modify `L29` in `runner.py`. `percent_gen(0, 35, 1)` means run test from cache ratio 0% to 35% with step=1%.

## Run Command

```sh
> python runner.py
> python parser.py
> gnuplot plot.plt
```

There are serveral command line arguments for `runner.py`:

- `-m`, `--mock`: Show the run command for each test case but not actually run it
- `-i`, `--interactive`: run these tests with output printed to terminal, rather than redirec to log directory.

The number of epochs to run is set to 3 for fast reproduce. You may change line containing `.override('epoch', [3])` to change the numer of epochs.


## Output Example

`python runner.py` will redirect all logs to `run-logs` directory. An short example of the `data.dat` looks like this:
```sh
> cat data.dat
